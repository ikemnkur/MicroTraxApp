I am trying implement a way users can pay for coin with crypto, however the user and I will be manually preforming the crypto transactions. But I need to have the a form that the user can fill out so that when they send the coin to me via third party app ill be able to check and confirm that they sent the right amount before giving them coins manually.

Also can you create a notifications system for the dashboard page, make below the cards and use mock data for now, add feature like regular one would have: Dimiss, (remind me later), and  view (Clicking to go to the relevant with that item) . The notifications should be for when: a user receives money, reloads thier balance, has another user pay to unlock thier items, has paid another users, has a fee, has been reported for misconduct, withdraws money successful, or has a pending reload/withdrawl 

Can you create a webpage for the server, I need to be able to edit records in the sql database via my phone.  


I am creating a react app and I am trying to design a custom wawy for users of the site to be able to place thier own adds on the website. I also need a way to integrate the ad as a componment in the react app. here a few thing that I want the ad system to have:

there ad create page should have a form:
Title,
Descsritption
Link
Format: regular, banner, popup, modal, video, and maybe even back ground audio ads or JS Canvas/Embeddable Applet.
Media to Upload: Image, GIF (less than 2 mb), Audio (Plus image 256x256), Video (<2.5mb), and maybe a JS Canvas Applet
The ad must have at least 3 quiz question to proof attention for giving users rewards (add functionalty to create a quiz about the add) - this can be optional
user reward amount in credits (0 - 100)
ad campaign bugdet in credits (2000 - 20000)
ad display frequency (low, light, moderate, high, agressive)



then I need to create a preview page and the actual ad component itself

Every time a ad is shown the host user losses some credits

the ads should be skippable after a random interval of time greater than 3 but less than 15.

Sometime I want the user to recieve a reward after watching/listening to the ad completely
A button should appear after the ad finishes playing, when click a reward modal should popup, 
it should only last for 5 seconds
The reward modal will display question to proof attention was paid to the ad
thier will be a 20 second timer to answer
Format: 4 Mulitple Choice or a Short answer question (not case sensitive &  inclusive [the exact answer is not needed])
one question will be choosen to reward the user if they answer correctly

Maybe a simple analytics page that list the actives ads for each user and the cost and views/impressions
